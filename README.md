* Conversion to grayscale
* Negative of an image
* Minimum path with 4-neighbor search
* Minimum path with 8-neighbor search
* Image clipping
* Linear interpolation
* Bilinear interpolation
* Bicubic interpolation
* Histogram equalization
* Search for connected regions
* Region of interest
* Image clipping

<b>Chapter 3</b>
* Gamma filter
* Edge Enhancing filter
* Embossing filter
* Box blur
* Sobel operator

<b>Misc</b>
* Simple threshold segmentation
* Adaptative threshold segmentation (Otsu's method)
* Generic convolution
