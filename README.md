Digital Image Processing experiments
====================================

Based on Digital Image Processing 3rd edition (Gonzalez et al.)

List of features implemented so far:

<b>Chapter 2</b>
* Conversion to grayscale
* Negative of an image
* Minimum path with 4-neighbor search
* Minimum path with 8-neighbor search
* Image scaling (linear interpolation)
* Histogram equalization
* Search for connected regions
* Region of interest with Kronecker product (not really working great)
