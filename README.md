Digital Image Processing experiments
====================================

Based on Digital Image Processing 3rd edition (Gonzalez et al.)

List of features implemented so far:

<b>Chapter 2</b>
* Conversion to grayscale
* Negative of an image
* Minimum path with 4-neighbor search
* Minimum path with 8-neighbor search
* Image clipping
* Image scaling (linear interpolation)
* Histogram equalization
* Search for connected regions
* Region of interest

<b>Chapter 3</b>
* Gamma filter
* Edge Enhancing filter
* Embossing filter
* Box blur

<b>Misc</b>
* Simple threshold segmentation
* Adaptative threshold segmentation (Otsu's method)
* General convolution
